		<h2>Foundational Concepts</h2>
		<p>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm</p>

		<h3>Definition</h3>
		<p>The Favor Solutions Network (“Favor SN”, “FSN”, “the Network”) is a mutual credit clearing system for voluntarily associated participants. It is made up of individuals and organizations (“Individual Members” and “Organization Members” / “Member Organizations”, together called “Members”) who wish to engage in mutually supportive economic interactions.</p>

		<p>Favor is the name of the currency used in the FSN. Quantities of Favor are designated by a lowercase ‘f’ followed by a number, e.g. “f200” represents two-hundred Favor. Favor are exchanged within the Favor SN’s zero-sum ledger. Purchasers’ balances are reduced. Suppliers’ balances are increased. And, the Favor SN charges each party a transaction fee of 1% for providing the service. In this way, the total sum of balances always equals f0.</p>

		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<p>The purpose of the Favor SN is to facilitate the networked exchange of goods and services.</p>

		<p>Favor’s core value to participants is free exchange.</p>

		<p>No extractive structures shall be built into the FSN. This means that the Favor SN does not charge interest on negative balances, and the Favor SN does not offer interest bearing loans or otherwise make investments into individuals, projects, or organizations other than itself.</p>

		<p>No part of the FSN’s structure is designed in a way which incentivizes or mechanically drives income inequality or socio-economic inequity. It is an economically neutral tool, which — even if wildly successful — would not repair economic injustice. It is, however, a critical tool for those who might — as it is also incapable of structurally increasing socio-economic inequity — unlike the U.S. Dollar and other central bank currencies, and also cryptocurrencies.</p>

		<h3>Scope of the Constitution</h3>
		<p>This Constitution describes the fundamental rules by which the Network is governed. This Constitution should seldom be changed. Granular processes and Policies ought to be more flexible. This Constitution outlines the need for various Policies and Processes. These Policies and Processes will be practiced in a living and consistently refining manner. A living record of them will be maintained in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EFeLnPLIZK3_aqq5Qi0gd2GE-bSxaW3-GfsARRvATVU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Favor Policy Manual</a> by those Circles which are responsible for their maintenance. This Constitution does, though, stipulate certain requirements for those Policies — what questions they must answer and affordances they must ensure.</p>
