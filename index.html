		<h2>Foundational Concepts</h2>
		<!-- <p>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm</p> -->

		<h3>Definition</h3>
		<p>The Favor Solutions Network (“Favor SN” / “FSN” / “the Network”) is a mutual credit clearing system for voluntarily associated participants. It is made up of individuals and organizations (“Individual Members” and “Organization Members” / “Member Organizations”, together called “Members”) who wish to engage in mutually supportive economic interactions.</p>

		<p>Favor is the name of the currency used in the FSN. Quantities of Favor are designated by a lowercase ‘f’ followed by a number, e.g. “f200” represents two-hundred Favor. Favor are exchanged within the Favor SN’s zero-sum ledger. Purchasers’ balances are reduced. Suppliers’ balances are increased. And, the Favor SN charges each party a transaction fee of 1% for providing the service. In this way, the total sum of balances always equals f0.</p>

		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<p>The purpose of the Favor SN is to facilitate the networked exchange of goods and services.</p>

		<p>Favor’s core value to participants is free exchange.</p>

		<p>No extractive structures shall be built into the FSN. This means that the Favor SN does not charge interest on negative balances, and the Favor SN does not offer interest bearing loans or otherwise make investments into individuals, projects, or organizations other than itself.</p>

		<p>No part of the FSN’s structure is designed in a way which incentivizes or mechanically drives income inequality or socio-economic inequity. It is an economically neutral tool, which — even if wildly successful — would not repair economic injustice. It is, however, a critical tool for those who might — as it is also incapable of structurally increasing socio-economic inequity — unlike the U.S. Dollar and other central bank currencies, and also cryptocurrencies.</p>

		<h3>Scope of the Constitution</h3>
		<p>This Constitution describes the fundamental rules by which the Network is governed. This Constitution should seldom be changed. Granular processes and Policies ought to be more flexible. This Constitution outlines the need for various Policies and Processes. These Policies and Processes will be practiced in a living and consistently refining manner. A living record of them will be maintained in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EFeLnPLIZK3_aqq5Qi0gd2GE-bSxaW3-GfsARRvATVU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Favor Policy Manual</a> by those Circles which are responsible for their maintenance. This Constitution does, though, stipulate certain requirements for those Policies — what questions they must answer and affordances they must ensure.</p>

		<div class="layout__special-section">
			<h3>Factors to Sunset upon the Conclusion of&nbsp;Phase&nbsp;One:</h3>
			<p>The Favor SN is a social permaculture design project from the holistic design firm SQGLZ. The FSN is governed through benevolent dictation by Deacon Rodda of SQGLZ. Deacon Rodda shall serve as the final arbiter of all decisions until the Favor SN’s Circle governance system is functioning autonomously and has achieved the tasks necessary to initiate Phase Two.</p>
			<p>When the Policies and Processes laid out in this Constitution have been fully drafted, the backend software and hardware have been configured to manage the ledger, and at least one front end interface is available for transactions, the FSN will begin to function under its own governance. Deacon Rodda will monitor this governance. If he cannot find a failure of the Circles to implement the specifics of this Constitution or the Policy Manual, then he shall declare the transition into Phase Two complete.</p>
			<p>During Phase One, the Favor SN, its assets, and everything related to the project are to be considered property of SQGLZ LLC. Upon successful transition to self-governance, the FSN will own itself.</p>

		</div><!-- PHASE ONE PROVISOS -->

		<img class="layout__favor-crest" src="images/favor-crest.svg" alt="crest for the Favor Solutions Network" nopin="nopin">

		<h2>Membership</h2>
		<h3>Membership Basics</h3>
		<p>Individuals may join the FSN by completing the Membership Onboarding Process.</p>

		<p>Organizations may join the FSN by completing the Organization Onboarding Process.</p>

		<p>Individual Members leave, are suspended, or are removed through the Individual Offboarding Process.</p>

		<p>Organizations leave, are suspended, or are removed through the Organization Offboarding Process.</p>

		<p>Onboarding and Offboarding Processes are to be maintained in the Favor Policy Manual. Each Process is to be monitored and updated as needed to ensure:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>That all new Members are provided comprehensive information concerning the Network’s expectations of them</li>
			<li>That Memberships are never duplicated or fraudulent</li>
			<li>That the Network is capable of contacting its Members in various ways</li>
			<li>That departing Members’ balances are accounted for — requiring that the total balance of the Network remains f0</li>
			<li>That Membership terms meet the requirements of U.S. financial and data regulations</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Member Credit Limits</h3>
		<p>Credit limits will change according to the Credit Limit Policy.</p>

		<p>The Credit Limit Policy must be consistent for all Members of the two respective types, Individual Members and Organization Members — such that all Individual Members are treated the same as each other and all Organizational Members are treated the same as each other. The two types of Membership are not to be treated the same as each other by the Credit Limit Policy.</p>

		<p>The Credit Limit Policy will require iteration to balance, and should seek:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>To maintain a stable valuation for the currency</li>
			<li>To provide sufficient credit to all Members such that they may engage fully in the Network</li>
			<li>To limit credit for all Members according to their capacity to provide goods and services to the Network</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The rules and mechanisms by which credit limits shall change will be maintained in public record on the Favor SN website.</p>

		<h3>Members and Circles</h3>
		<p>Individual Members participate in governance through Circles. Individuals who are not Members of the Network may not participate in Circles.</p>

		<p>Members can become Circle Members and participate in Circle processes through the various Circles’ Onboarding and Participation Processes. Each Circle’s Onboarding, Participation, and Offboarding Processes and Policies must be consented to by the Council both upon creation and whenever amended.</p>

		<p>Each Circle’s Onboarding, Participation, and Offboarding Processes will be created to ensure:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>That no gatekeeping or quotas will be imposed on the basis of identity</li>
			<li>That new Circle members are admitted based on their fitness for the work and processes of the Circle in question</li>
			<li>That the criteria for fitness for any given Circle are unambiguous and transparent</li>
			<li>That it is clear what the Circle’s Members may expect of the Circle and what the Circle expects of its Members</li>
			<li>That there is a clear process for evaluating the fulfillment of responsibilities and for the removal of Circle Members, if necessary</li>
		</ol>

		<p>The above criterion constitutes the basis on which the Council may scrutinize a Circle’s Onboarding, Participation, and Offboarding Processes.</p>

		<p>These Circle Processes and Policies must be made public. Other internal Circle Processes and Policies may remain private.</p>

		<h3>Members and the Council</h3>
		<p>Each Circle sends a single Circle Member as spokesperson to represent the Circle within the Council. The Council is made up of no other entities than these representatives.</p>

		<p>While both individuals and organizations may be admitted to the Favor SN, only Individual Members may participate in governance and maintenance of the Network; Organization Members may not.</p>

		<p>Individual Membership confers neither obligation nor right to participate in governance and maintenance of the FSN. Individual Members belonging to a Member Organization may participate in Circles. Their roles shall not constitute any relationship between either the Circle and the organization in question or grant the organization a role in governance and maintenance of the FSN.</p>

		<h2>Policy</h2>

		<p>For matters of procedure which ought to be more easily adjusted through iteration and dialog, the Favor Policy Manual will be maintained as a repository of the Network’s practices. These Policies describe specific critical operations of Circles and the Council.</p>

		<p>Current thinking on best practices for Members will also be maintained in the Favor Policy Manual.</p>

		<p>Differentiating between the above two types of inclusions in the Policy Manual: Circles and the Council must abide by, or change, their Policies, and update the Policy Manual. Members may use the Policy Manual as a guide in matters such as the valuation of goods and services, resolution of disputes, etc. Support which Members receive from the Network, however, may be limited if their use of Favor differs greatly from stated best practices.</p>

		<p>In the event of a conflict between the two, the Constitution of the Favor SN, supersedes the Favor Policy Manual.</p>

		<p>It is the responsibility of the Council to judge policy and decide on intended whole systems functionality. It is the responsibility of Circles to uphold these decisions through the tasks delegated to them by the Council upon the consent of each Circle to the tasks as delegated.</p>

		<p>Policies to be maintained within the Policy Manual include, but are not limited to:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Individual Member Onboarding</li>
			<li>Organization Member Onboarding</li>
			<li>Individual and Organization Membership Termination and Offboarding</li>
			<li>Circle Instantiation and Dissolution</li>
			<li>The creation and execution of Proposals</li>
			<li>The methods of maintaining transparency, per Circle</li>
			<li>Credit limit setting and adjustment mechanisms</li>
			<li>The Community Mastery Board Process</li>
			<li>The Grievance Process</li>
			<li>The Special Meetings Processes</li>
			<li>General Meetings Policy</li>
			<li>Policies regarding default, probate, and conflict mediation</li>
			<li>A listing of communications technologies currently in use</li>
			<li>Communications best practices</li>
		</ul>

			<h3>The Immutable Clause</h3>

			<p>One Policy, alone, shall require 100% consent of all Favor Solutions Network members to be changed:</p>

			<p class="type__immutable">Balances shall incur no interest or fees. Transactions in Favor are not loans. There is no interest charged by the Favor SN for past charges.</p>
			<p class="type__immutable">No process other than unanimous consent of all Network Members can alter this clause of the Constitution in any way.</p>

			<div class="small-space"></div>

		</div><!-- THE IMMUTABLE MOTHERFUKIN CLAUSE! That’s right, homie; this clause ain’t goin’ nowhere. -->
		<div class="medium-space"></div>

		<h2>Circles</h2>
		<p>Circles may be self-organized among Members. The creation of a Circle may also be initiated by the Council.</p>

		<p>In order to form, a Circle must present the following documentation:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Statement of Purpose</li>
			<li>Member Onboarding and Offboarding Process</li>
			<li>Participation Process</li>
			<li>Responsibilities in the form of Domains</li>
			<li>Decision-making process, regarding the Circle’s Council representative selection methods and representation expectations</li>
			<li>Temporal scope including renewal specification</li>
			<li>A Dissolution Process</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Once a Circle has been organized according to the above specifications it may be ratified by consensus of the Council. The Council may choose not to ratify a Circle if the Circle’s Statement of Purpose does not present a meaningful and beneficial addition to the Council.</p>

		<p>Ratified Circles will have a seat at the Council.</p>

		<p>It is the responsibility of each Circle to choose their Council representative. Circle’s may determine their representative by any means and frequency which suits the Members of that Circle.</p>

		<p>The drafting and maintenance of Policies listed in this Constitution is to be delegated to Circles by the Council. The Council will then come to consensus on these Policies or send them back to the Circles for revision until complete. These Policies are to be documented in the Favor Policy Manual. Circles will maintain the Policy and Process documents for which they are responsible for view by the public in locations to be specified in the Policy Manual.</p>

		<p>Circles are responsible for implementing the decisions they make over their respective domains and submitting proper documentation according to the Transparency Policy.</p>

		<p>Circles may choose to dissolve or be dissolved by the Council following that Circle’s Dissolution Process. Each Circle’s Dissolution Process must account for the handing off of all of its responsibilities. Even if a Circle intends to exist in perpetuity, it must have a plan for possible dissolution. This plan must exist before the Circle’s ratification.</p>

		<h2>Council</h2>
		<p>The Council is made up of representatives from each Circle.</p>

		<p>The Council makes decisions by full consensus, with one exception. When a decision concerns the responsibilities of one specific Circle, that Circle’s position is recorded but cannot block consensus. In this way a Circle cannot block the moving of a responsibility to another Circle if it is the unanimous will of the remaining Circles, or block its own dissolution by the Council.</p>

		<p>Circles are responsible for their internal management. The Council is responsible for the evaluation of the performance of Circles.</p>

		<p>The Council makes final determinations concerning the responsibilities of each Circle and may specify requirements for the satisfactory fulfillment of those responsibilities.</p>

		<p>The Council, as a group, cannot assume executive responsibility. Executive responsibilities include the direct management or performance of tasks and providing of services involved in fulfilling the needs of the Network. The Council, as a working group, exists to specify, delegate, and scrutinize the fulfillment of responsibilities. The Circles exist to determine how those responsibilities will be fulfilled — at a technical level — and to complete the tasks involved.</p>

		<h2>Process</h2>
		<p>Council decisions supersede Circle decisions.</p>

		<p>Member concerns are addressed and moved toward resolution using the Community Mastery Board Process and Grievance Process.</p>

		<p>Members may call Special Meetings by following the Special Meeting Process. The Special Meeting Process will outline the steps for calling a Special Meeting of the Favor SN. Calling a Special Meeting will require that documentation of the following are comprehensively and intelligibly provided:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>That the concern in question is not addressed through current documentation and processes, and concerned Members have committed a reasonable effort to solve for their concerns through established resources</li>
			<li>That the Community Mastery Board process has been exhausted with regard to the concern</li>
			<li>The Grievance Process has been followed, if applicable, and documentation of efforts have been provided to the Culture Circle</li>
			<li>That the relevant Circle, or Circles, have been made aware of the concern and have neither solved for the concern or provided a plan and timeline for solution</li>
			<li>That the concern is systemic or institutional and not personal — personal concerns not solved through the Grievance Process should be elevated to mediation, not Special Meetings</li>
		</ol>

		<p>All Individual Members of the FSN may attend a Special Meeting. All Council Members must attend each Special Meeting. A Circle whose Council Representative cannot attend a Special Meeting must determine a new representative. Each special meeting must be facilitated by a member of the Culture Circle who is not a Council Member. The Special Meeting Process may specify terms by which other Members are requested or required to attend Special Meetings. The Special Meeting Process will also include provisions for the following concerns:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>How all Individual Members will be notified of Special Meetings</li>
			<li>What technologies are to be used which will facilitate attendance by as many interested Individual Members as possible</li>
			<li>How Individual Members will participate</li>
			<li>How Council Members will participate</li>
			<li>By what method of facilitation productive conclusions will be encouraged</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Circles determine their own meeting methods, norms, and processes.</p>

		<p>Council quorum is reached once each Circle is represented by one unique person. A Member may be a member of multiple Circles, but may not represent more than one Circle in the Council.</p>

		<p>The Favor SN is opposed to the use of the filibuster. The expectations of Circles to provide a Council representative, and the solution for actions which functionally amount to filibuster and block consensus through refraining from dialog, shall be covered in the General Meetings Policy.</p>

		<p>The Member who represents a Circle in the Council must represent that Circle according to that Circle’s documented decision-making processes.</p>

		<p>Council meeting notes and decisions are to be posted publicly according to the Transparency Policy.</p>

		<h2>Finances</h2>
		<p>The Council controls Favor SN funds, approves budgets (in Favor and other currencies held by the Network), and sets Favor credit limits for Circles.</p>

		<h2>Constitutional Modification Process</h2>
		<p>The Council may change the Constitution according to the following process:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Council comes to consensus on changing the Constitution</li>
			<li>Council notifies all Individual Members of change</li>
			<li>60 days are given to collect concerns and objections</li>
			<li>All concerns and objections are documented</li>
		</ol>

		<p>The Council must make reasonable effort to contact all Individual Members and notify them of the pending change. Concerns are merely included in the documentation for the amendment. Objections must be reviewed to determine whether they meet the criterion of a Relevant Objection. In the event of a Relevant Objection the Council must do one of the following:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Abort the amendment process</li>
			<li>Alter the amendment and resubmit it to all Members</li>
			<li>Override the objection and provide thorough explanation as to why</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Categories of Relevant Objections</p>

		<ol>
			<li>This amendment will violate the FSN’s stated purpose, in this specific way, for these specific reasons.</li>
			<li>This amendment is unsafe because it [ is illegal / could cause physical harm ].</li>
			<li>This amendment contradicts another FSN Policy without replacing its function.</li>
			<li>This amendment will not accomplish its stated purpose for given concrete reasons.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Examples of Invalid Objections</p>

		<ol>
			<li>This amendment fails to uphold a political or ideological position outside of the FSN’s stated purpose to facilitate networked exchange without extraction.</li>
			<li>It just doesn’t feel right.</li>
			<li>This isn’t how another organization does things.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Alteration of the Immutable Clause, alone, requires the explicit consent of all Members.</p>

		<h2>Failure &#38; Dissolution</h2>

		<p>There are a number of actions and failures to act which could bring about the collapse of the Favor Solutions Network. Among them are:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Failure of the Circles to fulfill their responsibilities</li>
			<li>Overreach of the Council into the responsibilities of Circles</li>
			<li>The formal or informal inclusion of political agendas or ideologies (<em><strong>any</strong> political agendas or ideologies</em>) in operations or decision-making</li>
			<li>Elevating popularity and personality above character and fitness as criterion for Circle inclusion and Council representation</li>
			<li>Individualistic ambition on the part of any Council Members, Circle Members in key roles, or as a general cultural blight within the Network</li>
			<li>Short-term or other small thinking</li>
			<li>Timidity</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Avoiding these failures is beyond the scope of any constitution or policy. These are matters of human moral strength, mental discipline, and patient awareness. These pitfalls cannot be designed out of a system — <em>and if they could, they should not be</em>. <strong>Overcoming these failings is the very adventure of our lives</strong>.</p>

		<p>Should the Favor SN fail entirely in these or any other ways, ceasing to functionally exist, Members will be without recourse to settle their balances. All who participate in the FSN do so of their own free will, acknowledge that Favor are not dollars (meaning that, outside of the Network, no one is owed anything or owes anything for the balances maintained here). As such, Members accept the possibility of systemic collapse and its adjoining annulment of all monetary balances on the ledger of the Favor Solutions Network.</p>
