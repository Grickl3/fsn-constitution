The Digitally Typeset Constitution of the Favor Solutions Network

Hi folks, if you’re reading this then you’re looking under the hood of the FSN Constitution. Sweet. There’s nothing to hide here other than maybe some potentially antiquated vanilla web development. I’m Deacon Rodda, founder of the design firm SQGLZ and the Favor Solutions Network. Thank you for checking out this project

The most essential things to understand are:

* Favor is a public resource
* The Repo exists for transparency
* You are welcome to use anything here

## Favor as a Public Resource
Favor credits are money. Money is best made available to everyone — systemically. This is not to say that anyone or everyone should just be given all the money they want. It is to say that society is best served by allowing anyone and everyone to use money on the same terms as everyone else.

Money is not a right. It is a gift. Money itself is a gift from our ancestors, and like so many other fantastic inventions of the sages of old, we have failed to steward it and cultivate it and make of it the best gift that we can offer to the generations which follow us.

It is too late for the dominant currency of the land, the U.S. dollar. It is too far gone. The dollar has radically mutated several times since its early days in the post colonial states. At every turn it has been warped to serve an agenda which includes the acceleration of wealth disparity and ecological exploitation.

So, SQGLZ and friends have come up with a new form of money, which will be one of many in a polyculture of economic solutions which are worthy gifts that we may feel at peace leaving to coming generations as a true gift.

## This Repo & Transparency
To the best of my knowledge, it’s really hard to fool the tracking system here on GitHub. So, this repo serves as a matter of record. It will show exactly what the constitution said, when, and who changed it. In this way, we can concretely establish what folks are agreeing to and when.

## Use Whatever Suits You
I, personally, think that this constitution represents a pretty meaningful grouping of design decisions. An example of a notable feature is that it holds to the Taoist principle of statecraft — that no law should be made which one is not in a position to enforce. This seemingly obvious principle is commonly overlooked by governments and other institutions the world over. So, while there are a lot things which we might want to outright eliminate, where we know we could not enforce such restrictions, we have instead simply put in place simpler rules not to create mechanics which might facilitate poor form.

For instance, speculation is a major blight in an heirloom currency. But, there’s no rule we could make that would be both enforcable and would completely eliminate it. So, unlike other institutions we have contented ourselves to assert that it is not best practice.

This and other features aimed at systemic elegance and balance are defining features of this document. If you see any elements which you’d like to use for any other system, grab ’em. Attribute or don’t. It’s fine either way. The interest here is that society iterate toward more wholesome ways of being, not that we get credit or own what we actually drew from the deep well we didn’t dig to begin with.
